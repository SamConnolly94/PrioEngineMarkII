# PrioEngineMarkII
The second iteration of Prio Engine. 

## Summary
This is designed to be a generic rendering engine, heavily influenced by Frank Luna's Programming with DirectX 12. Initially the plan is to support DirectX 12, loading models, moving models, and providing a fairly straight forwards method to add shaders.

## Long Term Goals
In the future, I'd like the user to be able to define if they want to use DX12 or OpenGL. At the moment, I'm just focussed on DX12.
